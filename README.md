# Geodesics in Curved SpaceTime

## About 
This mathematica notebook allows you to run animated numerical simulations of a test mass, or a photon in Kerr, Schwarzchild, Slow Rotating and Minkowski space time. By default the animation always displays a Black Sphere of radius 2. This has to be intepreted as the Schwarzchild radius for Black holes, and it must neglected when running the simulation in Minkowski.

### Controls
You can change the following parameters directly in the interface,

 * Choose massive or a massless particle for simulation
 * Total simuation time
 * Initial conditions
 * Angular momentum of the Black hole, or spherical Mass

### Additional Tweaks 

You can change the code to fix the range of spatial coordinates in the animation, right now it is set at Automatic.
